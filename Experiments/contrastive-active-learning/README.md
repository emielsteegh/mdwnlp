# Contrastive Active Learning (CAL) 

(`-> Original`)[https://github.com/mourga/contrastive-active-learning/]

modified version to make the dataloaders work for the `ORNL` datasets. There were some major problems with version mismatching especially around the `datasets` package which does not exist on this version.

Modified files:
 - `/aquisition`
 - `/analysis` 
 - `/utilities`
 - `run_al.py`
 - `sys_config.py`
