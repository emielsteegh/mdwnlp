# Experiments for "No Labels? No Problem"

Broadly speaking this module contains three parts:
 - A [modified version of the contrastive active learning library](contrastive-active-learning/) to work with the ORNL dataset on google colab
 - A [notebook outlining all the experiments](experiments-notebook.ipynb)
 - And a [notebook to examine the results](results.ipynb)
